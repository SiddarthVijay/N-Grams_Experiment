  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Probability of a sentence can be calculated by the probability of sequence
    of words occuring in it. We can use Markov assumption, that the probability
    of a word in a sentence depends on the probability of the word occuring just
    before it. Such a model is called first order Markov model or the bigram
    model.
